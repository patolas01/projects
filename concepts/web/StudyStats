StudyStats

App to help studying and remembering stuff

The user creates a study, provides content so the program can generate questions.
Everyday for X time, the program generates different questions about everything on the content, and analyze it, make a score for how many right answers the user got.
Create a graph with all the values, let the user know if he needs to study more and make specific questions about the wrong ones.

Might need an API or an AI to generate the questions.
